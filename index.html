<h3>the career</h3>
<p>
The four embark on surreal journeys on their own, which are then interwoven together; the action is set in Boopelite City, a gigantic and whirring metropolis where many of the buildings look like archaic clockworks. The streets are constantly teeming with characters of intensely varied description, and the sidewalks are crammed with anthropomorphic animals, robots, anthropomorphic foods, anthropomorphic sea creatures, and more. The four roommates live in a treehouse, which sits in the middle of the city, surrounded by the forest, the seas and anywhere else the friends could possibly go.
Pig (voiced by Matt L. Jones) – a dim-witted anthropomorphic pig who has a large liking for pickles. Pig is the "fool" of the group and causes most of their problems. Pig is hardly able to read by himself. He says his catchphrase "that's my favorite!", often when he sees something or someone he likes. His name may be short for Pignatius.

<h3>their funny</h3>
<p>
 Pig is resistant to what would normally be life-threatening injuries.[7]
Goat (voiced by Candi Milo) – a sweet and cheerful anthropomorphic goat woman[8] who has been Pig's roommate for the past 29 years.[9] She is the "artist" of the group being able to play the guitar and having a penchant for acting. Goat can be very easily irritated by others' antics and often displays anger, causing her to babble, speak gibberish, and occasionally puff up her chest when angry (e.g. "Flib flabbin' flibble flubbin!"). Her catchphrase is "Totally goatally", which she says when she agrees with something. Goat has normal human-shaped ears (not goat-shaped) normally obscured underneath the locks of hair on the sides of her head. The horns on top of her head have holes in them.
Banana (voiced by Thomas F. Wilson) – a lazy, selfish anthropomorphic banana who enjoys playing video games. He has boy scouts for henchmen. Banana is the "wise-guy" of the group who loves to have fun and pull pranks. Banana is afraid of primates of all species, because they eat his kind. Banana tends to cry when put into pressure but quickly stops. He says his catchphrase "Sweet mama's monkeys" when he is surprised or shocked, and "simpledy doo" after finishing a task.

<h3>their happy</h3>
<p>
Cricket (voiced by Paul Rugg) – an anthropomorphic cricket who is a genius inventor and speaks with a lisp. Cricket is the "brains" of the group. He is also the most responsible of the four and usually is forced to clean up their messes. Cricket has a crush on Goat, and while she has hugged him (and Banana/Pig simultaneously) and said she loves him, this can simply be behavior towards a pal. He sometimes says "Holy laser farts", when he is surprised or shocked.
Burgerstein, Cricket's lab assistant (voiced by John DiMaggio). He has a burger for a head and is made up of machines and other things. As his name implies, he is based on Frankenstein's Monster. He is called a "burgerbrain" by Cricket often, and Burgerstein grunts or babbles to express his intentions. In some episodes, Burgerstein temporarily becomes smart due to Cricket's inventions.
Goat's reflection (voiced by Milo) is seen in many episodes as Goat looks in the mirror often for self-admiration or grooming. She is eventually revealed to be a distinct entity, and she and Goat get into an argument when TJ gives the reflection the 'Customer of the Day' award even though it was Goat who got him a soufflé.
Thomas Jefferson (later nicknamed TJ) debuts in "The Chronicles of Cutesachusetts" where he emerges from a nickel to battle Goat, and later saves the day by battling Lady Primavera. He later runs a smoothie café.

<h3>their good</h3>
<p>
 in "Zombie Broheims" where he prevents Goat from being Customer of the Day because he swore to hate her forever. While discussing cookies she made, he calls Betsy Ross a hag.
Sleazy Beave (voiced by Jeff Bennett) – a male beaver who debuted in "Fudge-pocalypse". Sleazy Beave is open to pretty much anything as he is nearly homeless. He was willingly about to marry Delooney Hamshank (by the force of Ma Hamshank) but was then pranked by Pig who was wearing the wedding outfit. He appears to have a secondary superhero personality named The Masked Maniac as well.
Rasta Rat (voiced by Bennett) – Rasta Rat is a very laid-back rat who has dreadlocks and speaks in a Jamaican accent. He wears a green, red, and yellow beanie hat. A running gag is he constantly gets slammed onto the fourth wall.
President of the Planet (voiced by James Adomian) – the dog who rules the entire planet. He can be a noble person when he wants to be, but can also be quite brute and honest in his opinions, like when he told Goat that her superpower was complete garbage without a second thought in "Super Space Meatball".
Junior Rangers (voiced by Candi Milo, Yuri Lowenthal and Maile Flanagan) – the Junior Rangers are the "boy scout" division of the Boopelite park rangers.

<h3>their good friends</h3>

children varying in species who do various activities like real life Boy Scouts. They are watched over by Banana, who often lazes on the job. Some of the rangers do work for Banana that differs from normal activities, such as pranking the Hamshanks[10] or rescuing Banana from Big Ballah Koala.[11]
Barton[12] is a rat.
Tom[12] and Tabitha[13] are alligators or crocodiles.
an elephant.
Ranger Rhino (voiced by Bennett) – a rhinoceros who is in charge of the Junior Rangers. He often tells off Banana for not doing his duty but still has a soft spot for him, such as in "Wheelbarrow Full of Nachos" he asks Banana to hang out with him.
Breakfast Burrito (voiced by John DiMaggio) – a very lazy burrito. For example, in "The Chronicles of Cutesachusetts", Banana simply asked him to put away a jar of peanut butter, only for him to immediately sit on his couch and fall asleep.
Armpit Willy (voiced by DiMaggio) – an alligator who wears a beanie and has thick, long armpit hairs. His catchphrase is "bushy bushy".
Lady Primavera Van de Snuggles (voiced by Dyana Liu) debuts in "The Chronicles of Cutesachusetts" and returns in "Gauntlet of Humiliation", where she makes a cameo appearance by visiting Armpit Willy at his pool when Pig makes a fast food delivery to him.
